\chapter{Introduction}

This is the technical reference manual of \dfastmi, hereafter \dfmi.
The purpose of the tools is to provide a first estimate of the bed level changes in the main channel if local interventions were to be implemented outside the main channel.
Such interventions include the construction of side channels and other alterations of the floodplain and embankments.
The conceptual framework and implementation in WAQMORF was originally developed by \citep{Sieben2008}.
To obtain the estimate of the bed level changes, the algorithm needs data on the river's behaviour.
These data include information on the probability distribution of discharge occurrences, the values of representative discharges, such as bankfull discharge, the general operation of any barriers, as well as the bedform celerities --- or propagation rates --- under various flow conditions.
Given the branch/reach of the intervention, the algorithm requires a series of \dflowfm simulations for different flow conditions.
For each condition, two simulations are required

\begin{itemize}
\item a reference simulation (without the intervention) and
\item a simulation with the local intervention implemented.
\end{itemize}

Based on these spatial data, the algorithm provides spatial estimates of the minimum, year-averaged and maximum bed level change due to the intervention once a (dynamic) equilibrium has been reached.

\section{Running \dfmi}

The program can run in three modes of which only two (\keyw{batch} and \keyw{gui}) are documented in the user manual\footnote{\label{fn:backward1}The program still includes a third mode for backward compatibility, the so-called command line interface, activated by means of \keyw{-{}-mode cli} on the command line.
This option is described in \Autoref{Chp:backward}.}.
Here in the Technical Reference Manual, we provide the full list of command line arguments:

\begin{tabular}{l|l|p{8cm}}
short & long & description \\ \hline
\keyw{-h} & \keyw{-{}-help} & show help text and exit \\
 & \keyw{-{}-mode} & run mode \keyw{batch}, \keyw{cli}\footref{fn:backward1} or \keyw{gui} (default: \keyw{gui} \\
 & \keyw{-{}-language} & language selection: \keyw{UK}.
The alternative \keyw{NL} is only included for the \keyw{CLI} backward compatibility mode. \\
 & \keyw{-{}-rivers} & name of river configuration file.
The \keyw{GUI} run mode requires a version 2 river configuration file.
The backward compatibility mode \keyw{CLI} requires a version 1 file.
The \keyw{BATCH} mode supports either format and adjusts accordingly.
The default file for the \keyw{BATCH} and \keyw{GUI} is the \keyw{Dutch\_rivers\_v2.ini} file.
The \keyw{CLI} mode defaults to \keyw{Dutch\_rivers\_v1.ini}. \\
 & \keyw{-{}-config} & name of analysis configuration file \\
\end{tabular}
