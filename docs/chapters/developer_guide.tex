\chapter{Developer Guide}\label{Chp:DevGuides}

\section{Introduction}

This chapter gives an overview of how \dfastmi can be setup for development.
After following this guide the developer should be able to run the software, run unit tests, generate the code coverage and debug through the tests and software using tools and development programs.

The development setup and configuration is done for usage of the Visual Studio Code IDE.
More information about \href{https://code.visualstudio.com/}{Visual Studio Code} can be found on the internet.
The development of Python code project within Deltares is mostly done with this tool.
Visual Studio Code is free for private and commercial use.
See the \href{https://code.visualstudio.com/license}{product license} for details.

\begin{Remark}
	\item This configuration cannot be used to build a standalone executable with Nuitka tooling.
	It is for development purposes only.
\end{Remark}

\section{Configuration}
The \dfastmi developer environment can be configured with a batch script.
This script will configure and install recommended tools.
User input is required to download and install these tools.
The batch file is located in the sub folder \textbf{BuildScripts} and is called \textbf{DevelopDfastmi.bat}.

The batch file will check for installed tooling for Anaconda/Miniconda.
If not installed it will ask the user to install the Anaconda/Miniconda tooling for you. 

\begin{Note}
You need to close the command line and re-open/restart the batch script as it needs to initialize the Conda tooling for the command line and PowerShell (used in VS Code).
\end{Note}

The batch file will check for installed tooling for VS Code.
If not installed it will ask the user to install the VS Code tooling for you. 

\begin{Note}
You need to close the command line and re-open / restart the batch script as it needs to initialize the VS Code tooling for the command line.
\end{Note}

After checking (and installing if needed) the VS Code code development application the batch script will install several important VS Code extensions needed for quick development.

\section{Configuration files}
As stated earlier we use Conda to create a clean Python environment to develop the \dfastmi application in.
We also use Poetry, a Python dependency management and packaging tool, to setup the needed packages for the development environment.
Poetry uses TOML\footnote{TOML : Tom's Obvious Minimal Language. A common format for configuration files.} files for the configuration (\textbf{poetry.toml}) and a lock file (\textbf{poetry.lock}) which store all information about the packages that we use for building \dfastmi.
More information about poetry.lock can be found on the \href{https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#installing-without-poetrylock}{Poetry website}.
Also we use a \textbf{setup.py} file used by the setup tools package to setup the application for development.
And last but not least a Python tools / interpreter configuration \textbf{pyproject.toml}.
This file configures the way Python packages should behave.

\subsection{Conda environment}
We setup a Conda environment so we have the Python interpreter we expect to be used by developers.
We do this so the developer always can create isolated environments that contain a specific version of Python and all the required dependencies for \dfmi.
This prevents conflicts between packages and ensures that \dfmi development environment is reproducible.

\section{Tooling}
For \dfastmi development we are using:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Anaconda, Miniconda, or Conda} to setup the Python environment.
Currently, we build using Python 3.9.12.
\item \emph{Poetry} to install the Python packages for the environment.
\item \emph{Visual Studio Code} to edit Python files, run the created (unit)tests, see/visualize the test coverage.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Conda / Python packages needed for \dfastmi}
This paragraph shows a list of the primary package dependencies which matches the specifications of the \textbf{pyproject.toml} file.
Each of these packages typically requires several other packages; we don't list those to simplify maintenance.

\subsection{Utility / install scripts}
We use several other batch scripts.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \keyw{CondaInstall.bat} used to install Miniconda, you need to restart the main script (\keyw{DevelopDfastmi.bat}) in a \emph{new} command line prompt because the command line prompt environment is updated after install.
	\item \keyw{VSCodeInstall.bat} used to install visual studio code on the client pc, you need to restart the main script (\keyw{DevelopDfastmi.bat}) in a \emph{new} command line prompt because the command line prompt environment is updated after install.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Visual Studio Code Extensions}
In VS Code we use extensions to find Python unit test, visualize coverage and debug our code.
To do this we install the following extensions.

\begin{longtable}{|p{4cm}|p{10cm}|}
	\caption{Extensions for developing with VS Code.} \\
	\hline
	\textbf{VS Code extension} & \textbf{Remark} \\ \hline
	\endfirsthead
	%
	Cameron.vscode-pytest & VS Code Pytest Extension. \\ \hline
	donjayamanne.python-environment-manager & A Visual Studio Code extension that provides the ability to via and manage all of your Python environments \& packages from a single place. \\ \hline
	ms-python.pylint & A Visual Studio Code extension with support for the Pylint linter.
	For more information on Pylint, see the \href{https://pylint.readthedocs.io/}{Pylint documentation}. \\ \hline
	ms-python.python & A Visual Studio Code extension with rich support for the Python language including features such as code navigation, code formatting, refactoring, variable explorer. \\ \hline
	ms-python.vscode-pylance & To provide performant Python language support. \\ \hline
	ryanluker.vscode-coverage-gutters & Display test coverage generated by lcov or xml in your editor over your developed code. \\ \hline
\end{longtable}


\subsection{VS Code user files}
The user files can be found in subfolder \textbf{.vscode}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \keyw{extensions.json} will reference the expected and recommended visual studio code extensions. It will not install them but inform the user what is missing to start developing.
	\item \keyw{launch.json} will configure VS Code what to do when an user will debug unit tests or start debugging the application.
	\item \keyw{settings.json} configured settings for visual studio code.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{TOML}
This file type is used by the Python interpreter to configure the application.
The TOML file format itself has nothing to do with Python, Poetry or VS Code but it is a configuration file which is easy to read.
For more information see \href{https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#toml-syntax}{TOML syntax website}.
Added configuration settings to the \textbf{pyproject.toml} file

\begin{enumerate}
	\item In section [tool.coverage.run] \keyw{source = ["dfastmi"]} will inform VS Code/Python/Python coverage tooling where to expect the coverage to apply to.
	\item In section [tool.pytest.ini\_options] \keyw{addopts = "---cov ---cov-report=term 
		\\ ---cov-report=xml:coverage-reports/coverage.xml"} will inform VS Code/Python/Python test tooling to apply coverage and generate output report to.
\end{enumerate}
