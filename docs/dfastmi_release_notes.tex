\section{Release 3.0.0}

\subsection{Key changes}

The key changes of this completely revised version are:

\begin{itemize}
\item The number of discharge level used for \dfmi analysis has changed from typically 3 to 6.
The discharge levels no longer depend on the characteristics of the measures.
They are fixed per branch/reach, although you don't have to provide results below the threshold discharge of the measure.
\item The new analysis algorithm only supports simulation results stored in netCDF UGRID files, such as the \dflowfm map-file.
\item Complete overview of analysis settings included in the report.
\item The tool is no longer supported in the Dutch language.
\item The WAQMORF compatible \keyw{cli} mode is no longer supported.
\item Configuration files of \dfmi version 2 are no longer supported by the GUI.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Known issues}

The known issues are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Fourier output files of \dflowfm are not yet supported.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Overview of all issues}

An overview of all closed issues since the release of version 2.0.10 is given in the table below.
