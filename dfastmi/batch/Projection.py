def project_xy_point_onto_line(xf: numpy.ndarray, yf: numpy.ndarray, xyline: numpy.ndarray) -> Tuple[numpy.ndarray, numpy.ndarray]:
    """
    Project points onto a line.

    For a set of points (xf, yf) the closest point P a line (xyline) is determined.
    The quantities returned are the distance (sf) measured along the line (xyline)
    for the closest point P, the signed distance (df) between the original point (xf, yf)
    and the projected point P. If the original point is located alongsize the line
    (xyline) then the distance (df) is the normal distance ... if the original point is
    located before or beyond the line (xyline), it will include an oblique distance component.
    The sign of the distance (df) is positive for points to the right and negative for points
    to the left of the line.

    Arguments
    ---------
    xf : numpy.ndarray
        Array containing the x coordinates of a set of points.
    yf : numpy.ndarray
        Array containing the y coordinates of a set of points.
    xyline : numpy.ndarray
        Array containing the x,y data of a line.

    Results
    -------
    sf : numpy.ndarray
        Array containing the distance along the line.
    df : numpy.ndarray
        Array containing the distance from the line (- for left, + for right).
