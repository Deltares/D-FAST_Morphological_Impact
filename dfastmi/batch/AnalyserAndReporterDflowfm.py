    Perform analysis based on D-Flow FM data.

    Read data from D-Flow FM output files, perform analysis and write the results
    to a netCDF UGRID file similar to D-Flow FM.

    Arguments
    ---------
    display : bool
        Flag indicating text output to stdout.
    report : TextIO
        Text stream for log file.
    nwidth : float
        normal width of the reach.
    filenames : Dict[Any, Tuple[str,str]]
        Dictionary of the names of the data file containing the simulation
        results to be processed. The conditions (discharge, wave conditions,
        ...) are the key in the dictionary. Per condition a tuple of two file
        names is given: a reference file and a file with measure.
    xykm : shapely.geometry.linestring.LineString
        Original river chainage line.
    old_zmin_zmax : bool
        Specifies the minimum and maximum should follow old or new definition.
    outputdir : Path
        Path of output directory.
    plotting_options : PlotOptions
        Class containing the plot options.
    initialized_config : AConfigurationInitializerBase
        DTO with discharges, times, etc. for analysis

    Returns
    -------
    success : bool
        Flag indicating whether analysis could be carried out.
