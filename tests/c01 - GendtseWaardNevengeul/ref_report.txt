This program implements the "WAQUA vuistregel" for the estimation of the local
morphological effects of a local measure (i.e. an adjustment to the river). See
"RWS-WD memo WAQUA vuistregel 20-10-08" for details).

It is based on an estimation of the equilibrium bed level changes in the main
channel that would occur eventually when river maintenance would not be
adjusted.

The effect is expressed in [m] as:

    year-averaged bed level change without dredging
    maximum bed level change (after flood season) without dredging
    minimum bed level change (after low season) without dredging

By means of these estimates bottlenecks can be identified. The results are not
suitable for direct estimation of the impact on the maintenance of the
navigation channel!

The yearly sediment load of the river determines the period in which the
equilibrium can be reached.


This is version 2.0.0.


The results are not valid for a combination of multiple measures, or for a
single measure extending over a distance more than 4 km!


In order to use D-FAST Morphological Impact you need to run reference and
scenario simulations on the same computational mesh.


================================================================================

The results of this program are three data files containing the characteristic
bed level changes. These files are:

    year-averaged change [m] without dredging in          "yearavg_dzb.out"
    maximum change [m] after flood without dredging in    "max_dzb.out"
    minimum change [m] after low flow without dredging in "min_dzb.out"

If the bed level changes are removed on a yearly basis, the impacted river reach
is estimated at 1319 m from the upstream edge of the impacted reach.

The program has ended !!!
