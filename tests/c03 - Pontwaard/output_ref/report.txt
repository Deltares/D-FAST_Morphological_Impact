D-FAST Morphological Impact implements an algorithm to estimate the local
morphological effects of a local intervention (i.e. an adjustment to the
river). The conceptual framework was originally introduced in
    "RWS-WD memo WAQUA vuistregel (Sieben, 2010)"
but it has been extended and improved over the years. Check the user manual
for the details of the currently implemented algorithm.

It is based on an estimation of the equilibrium bed level changes in the
main channel that would occur eventually when river maintenance would not
be adjusted.

The effect is expressed as:

    year-averaged bed level change [m] without dredging
    maximum bed level change [m] without dredging
    minimum bed level change [m] without dredging

By means of these estimates bottlenecks can be identified. The results are
not suitable for direct estimation of the impact on the maintenance of the
navigation channel!

The combination of the total equilibrium sedimentation volume and the
yearly sediment load of the river determines the period over which the
equilibrium can be reached.

This is version 3.1.2.


In order to use D-FAST Morphological Impact you need to run reference and
scenario simulations on the same computational mesh.

The result of this program is one netCDF file named:

    dfastmi_results.nc

containing three variables containing the characteristic bed level changes:

    avgdzb: year-averaged change [m] without dredging
    maxdzb: maximum change [m] after flood without dredging
    mindzb: minimum change [m] after low flow without dredging

If the bed level changes are removed on a yearly basis, the impacted river reach
is estimated at 989 m from the upstream edge of the impacted reach.

The program has ended !!!
