# D-FAST Morphological Impact

This is one of the [Deltares](https://www.deltares.nl) Fluvial Assessment Tools.
The purpose of this tool is to provide a first estimate the morphological impact of engineering measures in rivers without doing a morphological simulation.
The user should carry out six steady state hydrodynamic simulations using [D-Flow FM](https://www.deltares.nl/en/software/module/d-flow-flexible-mesh/).
The results of these simulations will be combined with some basic morphological characteristics to arrive at the estimated impact.
For more details see the documentation section.

## Documentation

The documentation consists of
* a LaTeX user manual including scientific description, and
* a [Technical Reference Manual](docs/techref/techref.md) in Markdown
the sources of both documents can be found in the `docs` folder.
