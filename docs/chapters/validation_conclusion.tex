\chapter{Conclusion}
The cases reported in \autoref{Chp:Backward} show that \dfmi version 3 gives the same results as earlier versions of \dfmi and WAQUA when run in backward compatibility mode using the same input data.
The cases studied in \autoref{Chp:Morphology} show that for moderate interventions (big enough to have substantial influence, but small enough to not exceed the validity assumptions of the method) \dfmi version 3 gives results that match well with the long-term morphological impact as determined by full morphological simulations especially with respect to the along-stream (1D) variability.
The cases studied in \autoref{Chp:Verschil} show that the results of the new approach, implemented in \dfmi version 3, are in line with the results of the previous methodology implemented by WAQMORF and \dfmi version 2.

The overall conclusion is that the results of \dfmi version 3 are reliable (valid) under the conditions described in chapter 3 (User Guidance) of the \citet{um}.
