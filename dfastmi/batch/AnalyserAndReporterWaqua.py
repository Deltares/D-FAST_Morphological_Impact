    Perform analysis based on WAQUA data.

    Read data from samples files exported from WAQUA simulations, perform
    analysis and write the results to three SIMONA boxfiles.

    Arguments
    ---------
    display : bool
        Flag indicating text output to stdout.
    report : TextIO
        Text stream for log file.
    reduced_output : bool
        Flag to indicate whether WAQUA output should be reduced to the area of
        interest only.
    tstag : float
        Number of days that the river is stagnant.
    discharges : Vector
        Array of discharges; one for each forcing condition. (Q list of discharges)
    apply_q : BoolVector
        A tuple of 3 flags indicating whether each value should be used or not.
    fraction_of_year : Vector
        Fraction of year represented by each forcing condition. (T list of fraction of year)
    rsigma : Vector
        Array of relaxation factors; one per forcing condition.
    ucrit : float
        Critical flow velocity [m/s].
    old_zmin_zmax : bool
        Specifies the minimum and maximum should follow old or new definition.
    outputdir : str
        Name of the output directory.

    Returns
    -------
    success : bool
        Flag indicating whether analysis could be carried out. (always true)
