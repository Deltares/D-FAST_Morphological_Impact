\chapter{Software maintenance}

\section{Version control}

GitHub is used for software version control.
The \href{https://github.com/Deltares/D-FAST_Morphological_Impact}{source code} of \dfastmi is located in the Deltares space on that platform.
Since \dfastmi builds on WAQMORF, the initial release of the new Python product is labeled as version 2.0.0.

\section{Security}

Code security is checked by
\begin{enumerate}
\item GitHub 'dependabot' tracking security reports for libraries on which \dfmi depends
\item SonarCloud identifying coding errors and maintenance issues
\item Sigrid checking coding risks and dependency age
\end{enumerate}

\section{Development environment and dependencies}

See \autoref{Chp:DevGuides}.

\section{Coding guidelines}

This program has been implemented following the Python PEP 8 style guide using Python 3.9.
The code has been documented using standard Python docstrings and type hinting.
For the static type checker \emph{mypy} is used.

\begin{Verbatim}
    > pip install mypy
    > mypy dfastmi
\end{Verbatim}

Variables associated with NumPy, netCDF4 and PyQt5 are not yet properly type checked.

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\tiny]
> mypy dfastmi
dfastmi\kernel.py:35: error: Skipping analyzing 'numpy': found module but no type hints or library stubs
dfastmi\io.py:32: error: Skipping analyzing 'numpy': found module but no type hints or library stubs
dfastmi\io.py:33: error: Skipping analyzing 'netCDF4': found module but no type hints or library stubs
dfastmi\batch.py:36: error: Skipping analyzing 'numpy': found module but no type hints or library stubs
dfastmi\batch.py:36: note: See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running_mypy.html#missing-imports
dfastmi\gui.py:33: error: Skipping analyzing 'PyQt5': found module but no type hints or library stubs
dfastmi\gui.py:34: error: Skipping analyzing 'PyQt5.QtGui': found module but no type hints or library stubs
dfastmi\gui.py:491: error: Cannot assign to a method
dfastmi\gui.py:491: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "Type[str]", variable has type "Callable[[str], str]")
dfastmi\cli.py:35: error: Skipping analyzing 'numpy': found module but no type hints or library stubs
dfastmi\cmd.py:35: error: Skipping analyzing 'numpy': found module but no type hints or library stubs
Found 10 errors in 6 files (checked 8 source files)
\end{Verbatim}

The final two errors reported for \keyw{dfastmi\textbackslash{}gui.py} (line:491) are caused by a statement to switch the configparser to case sensitive mode while creating the data structure to be saved to file; most likely the data type is not properly set in the configparser definition.
That code line conforms to the configparser documentation and works properly as is.

A consistent coding style is enforced by means of the \href{https://pypi.org/project/black/}{black} code formatter.
This formatter is implemented as a GitHub Action such that code is automatically formatted after each push.
The same process also uses \href{https://pypi.org/project/isort/}{isort} for automatically sorting all imports.
To run the code formatter locally, perform 

\begin{Verbatim}
    > pip install black
    > black dfastmi
\end{Verbatim}

\section{Automated building of code} \label{Sec:AutoBuild}

A \href{https://dpcbuild.deltares.nl/project/DFast_DFastMorphologicalImpact}{TeamCity space} has been set up at Deltares under which projects for building, testing and signing of binaries have been configured.
Note that this environment is only available within Deltares.
The Nuitka compiler is used to build a binary by means of the following command \textbf{BuildDfastmi.bat} included in the \textbf{BuildScripts}.

\section{Automated testing of code}

See \autoref{Chp:TestPlan} and \autoref{Chp:TestReport}.

\section{Automated Generation of Documentation}

The documentation has been written in a combination of LaTeX and markdown files which are maintained in the GitHub repository alongside the source code.
The PDF version of the user manual and this technical reference manual are generated automatically as part of the daily cycle of building all manuals on the Deltares TeamCity server.
See the link provided in \autoref{Sec:AutoBuild}.
