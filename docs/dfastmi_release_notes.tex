\parbox{\textwidth}{%
\dfastmi version 3 is the successor of \dfastmi version 2 and WAQMORF.
This new version implements a generalized algorithm for estimating the sedimentation length and the long-term morphological response of the main channel to changes, so-called interventions, in the flood plains.
The tool requires the results of pairs of \dflowfm computations (with and without the intervention) for a given set of flow conditions.
}}

\section{Installation}
\dfastmi is distributed as a plain zip-file.
To install the software, unzip the file into an appropriate location, say \keyw{d:\textbackslash{}App\textbackslash{}dfastmi3}.
Start the software by running \keyw{d:\textbackslash{}App\textbackslash{}dfastmi3\textbackslash{}dfastmi.exe}.
For more details on the run procedure, see the \dfmi User Manual.

\section {Documentation list}
The following documentation is distributed with this release:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \dfastmi User Manual
\item \dfastmi Technical Reference Manual
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Release summary}
\section{Key changes summary}

The key changes of this completely revised version are:

\begin{itemize}
\item The number of discharge level used for \dfmi analysis has changed from typically 3 to 6.
The discharge levels no longer depend on the characteristics of the interventions.
They are fixed per branch/reach, although you don't have to provide results below the threshold discharge of the intervention.
\item The new analysis algorithm only supports simulation results stored in netCDF UGRID files, such as the \dflowfm map-file.
\item Complete overview of analysis settings included in the report.
\item The tool is no longer supported in the Dutch language.
\item The WAQMORF compatible \keyw{cli} mode is no longer supported.
\item Configuration files of \dfmi version 2 are no longer supported by the GUI.
\end{itemize}

\section{Known issues}

The known issues are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Fourier output files of \dflowfm are not yet supported.
\end{itemize}

\section{Overview of all issues}

An overview of all closed issues since the release of version 2.0.10 is given in the table below.
